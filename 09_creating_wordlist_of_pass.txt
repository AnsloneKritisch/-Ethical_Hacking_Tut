We took the handshake and now i want to create a wordlist of all the possible words can be the pass word
so we are going to use crunch to do this 

Basic Format will be Crunch [min] [max] [characters] -t [pattern] -o [filename]

step 1 -> i am not using the patten , i am just using the char and filename 

-> crunch 6 8 anshu12345 -o test.txt

step 2 -> if i wanto check all the char created will be shown by this command

-> cat test.txt
